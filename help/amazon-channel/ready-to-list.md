# [!UICONTROL Ready to List]

The _[!UICONTROL Ready to List]_ tab shows your [!DNL Commerce] catalog products that meet your listing settings and are ready to publish to Amazon as a **new** listing. Unlike other listing tabs, this tab does not always appear on the [_[!UICONTROL Product Listings]_](./managing-product-listings.md) page.

The _[!UICONTROL Ready to List]_ tab appears only when [**[!UICONTROL Automatic List Action]**](./product-listing-actions.md) in your listing settings is set to `Do Not Automatically List Eligible Products`. This setting tells Amazon sales channel that any new Amazon listings must be published manually.

When [**[!UICONTROL Automatic List Action]**](./product-listing-actions.md) is set to `Automatically List Eligible Products`, Amazon sales channel automatically publishes new listings for your eligible catalog products. Because new listings are published automatically, the _[!UICONTROL Ready to List]_ tab is not displayed.

Under _[!UICONTROL Actions]_:

- **[!UICONTROL Publish Product to Amazon]**: Choose to republish the listing to the [!DNL Amazon Marketplace]. See [Publish an Amazon Listing](./publish-listings-manually.md)

Under **[!UICONTROL Select]** in the _[!UICONTROL Action]_ column:

- **[!UICONTROL Publish On Amazon]**: Choose to republish the listing to the [!DNL Amazon Marketplace]. See [Publish an Amazon Listing](./publish-listings-manually.md).

- **[!UICONTROL View Details]**:Â Choose to view listing details, including the [Listing Activity Log](./product-listing-details.md#listing-activity-log), [Buy Box Competitor Pricing](./product-listing-details.md#buy-box-competitor-pricing), and [Lowest Competitor Pricing](./product-listing-details.md#lowest-competitor-pricing). This action is for viewing only. No changes can be made in the listing details. See [View Details](./product-listing-details.md).

You have a few options to manually [publish a new listing to Amazon](./publish-listings-manually.md).

>[!NOTE]
>If you have listings in process, the number of listings are displayed in a message above the tabs.
