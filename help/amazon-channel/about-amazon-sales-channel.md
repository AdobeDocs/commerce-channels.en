# About the [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel]

[!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] provides the Amazon sales channel extension, which seamlessly integrates your [!DNL Commerce] Admin with your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account. After [onboarding](./amazon-onboarding-home.md), [!DNL Commerce] becomes a "central command center" for managing and controlling your Amazon listings, orders and inventory, and pricing for your Amazon store.

[Store integration](./store-integration.md) connects your [!DNL Commerce] instance and Amazon to sync data between both platforms. Amazon sales channel enables you to:

- [Onboard](./amazon-onboarding-home.md) and integrate one or more [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] accounts with Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source.

- Import and sync your existing Amazon listings and match to products in your [!DNL Commerce] catalog, creating a centralized product catalog.

- Create and manage Amazon listings for products in your [!DNL Commerce] catalog.

- View and fulfill (ship) orders in [!DNL Commerce] and Amazon, syncing order status, payment, and refund information.

- View logs for analysis and errors for [competitive prices](./competitive-price-analysis.md), [listing changes](./listing-changes-log.md), and [communication issues](./communication-errors-log.md).

Access your Amazon stores to view and manage all of these features, account information, listings, orders, and more on the Amazon sales channel [home page](./amazon-sales-channel-home.md).
