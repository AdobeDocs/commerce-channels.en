# Incomplete Listings

The _[!UICONTROL Incomplete]_ tab lists the [!DNL Commerce] catalog products that meet your Amazon eligibility requirements (defined in your [listing rules](./listing-rules.md)), but are missing information required by Amazon (such as the Amazon ASIN or a defined product condition).

There are four possible causes for an incomplete listing, each identified by its status.
