# Inactive Listings

The _[!UICONTROL Inactive]_ tab shows your products that have been published to Amazon but are not active on the [!DNL Amazon Marketplace]. Your listings could be inactive for a few different reasons. For example, you might not be eligible to list that particular brand. Inactive listings are dictated by Amazon's listing standards and your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account permissions.

- **[!UICONTROL End Listing(s) on Amazon]**: Choose to remove all selected listings from the [!DNL Amazon Marketplace]. See [End an Amazon Listing](./end-listings-manually.md).

- **[!UICONTROL Edit Listing Overrides]**: Choose to change the override settings for the listing. See [Overrides](./overrides.md) or [Edit or remove an override](./creating-editing-overrides.md#edit-override-single-listing).

- **[!UICONTROL Create Alias Seller SKU]**: Choose to create an Alias SKU (stock Keeping unit) that can be used to create an Amazon listing from the same catalog product. See [Create an Alias Seller SKU](./create-alias-seller-sku.md).

- **[!UICONTROL Switch to Fulfilled by Amazon/Merchant]**: Choose to change the fulfillment method associated to the order. See [Configure Fulfilled By settings](./fulfilled-by.md#configure-fulfilled-by-settings).
