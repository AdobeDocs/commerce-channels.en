# Amazon Store Dashboard

In the _[!UICONTROL Amazon Stores]_ view on Amazon sales channel home page, you can click **[!UICONTROL View Store]** on a store card to open the store dashboard.

The store dashboard is the primary location for you to view the activity for each of your Amazon stores. With your [!DNL Amazon Seller] stores added and integrated, the orders and sales track through your store data view. On the dashboard, you can view revenue, track trends, and review sales data for your listings. Listings and sales are further grouped and tracked by listing type, including active, inactive, and in-progress.

You can also access your [store settings](./ob-store-review.md), [manage your listings](./managing-product-listings.md), and view sales data and recent order information.
