# Third-party listings

The third-party listing settings are part of your store listing settings. Listing settings are accessed from the [store dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md).

These settings determine if your [!DNL Commerce] catalog imports products from your existing [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] listings. It is a best practice to import listings from Amazon, to ensure that all listings have matching [!DNL Commerce] products. When your listings are part of your [!DNL Commerce] catalog, you can manage all of your products from a single catalog and use Amazon sales channel features. These features include fulfillment and order management with Amazon, intelligent repricing, and quantity management.

When configured to import your Amazon listings, Amazon sales channel imports your Amazon listings into your [!DNL Commerce] catalog, attempting to match them to existing products. If a match is not automatically found, you can import the Amazon listing as a new [!DNL Commerce] product or manually match the listing to a product.

If you choose to import your Amazon listings, choose the [!DNL Commerce] attributes with values for Amazon Seller SKU and Amazon ASIN. If you do not have [!DNL Commerce] [product attributes](./ob-creating-magento-attributes.md), consider creating and assigning them. Mapping these attributes helps correctly match imported Amazon listings to your [!DNL Commerce] products.

The initial listing import initiates when [store integration](./store-integration.md) is complete. Afterward and based on your cron settings, [!DNL Commerce] continually checks for newly added Amazon listings (not created in Amazon Sales Channel) and updates your [!DNL Commerce] catalog according to your third-party listings settings.
