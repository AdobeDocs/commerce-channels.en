# New third-party listings

The _[!UICONTROL New Third Party]_ tab shows your existing Amazon listings that have not been matched to a product in your [!DNL Commerce] catalog. To use listing management for quantity, pricing, handling time, and more, each of your Amazon listings must be matched (assigned) to a product in your [!DNL Commerce] catalog. You have a few options to assign a listing to a product in your [!DNL Commerce] catalog.

Under _[!UICONTROL Actions]_:

- **[!UICONTROL Create New Catalog Product(s)]**: Choose to use the information in the Amazon listing to automatically create a product in your [!DNL Commerce] catalog. This process matches the Amazon listing to the new catalog product automatically. See [Create and Assign Catalog Products](./creating-assigning-catalog-products.md).

- **[!UICONTROL Attempt Automatic Match]**: Choose to attempt automatic matching for the selected listings to your catalog based on your current [Catalog Search](./catalog-search.md) options in your listing settings. If you modify your _[!UICONTROL Catalog Search]_ options, this action allows you to attempt the matching process again.

Under _[!UICONTROL Select]_:

- **[!UICONTROL Assign Catalog Product]**: Choose to match the listing with a product in your [!DNL Commerce] catalog manually. See [Create and Assign Catalog Products](./creating-assigning-catalog-products.md).

- **[!UICONTROL Create New Catalog Product]**: Choose to use the information in the Amazon listing to automatically create a product in your [!DNL Commerce] catalog. This process matches the Amazon listing to the new catalog product automatically. See [Create and Assign Catalog Products](./creating-assigning-catalog-products.md).

- **[!UICONTROL View Details]**:Â Choose to view listing details, including the [Listing Activity Log](./product-listing-details.md#listing-activity-log), [Buy Box Competitor Pricing](./product-listing-details.md#buy-box-competitor-pricing), and [Lowest Competitor Pricing](./product-listing-details.md#lowest-competitor-pricing). This action is for viewing only. No changes can be made in the listing details. See [View Details](./product-listing-details.md).
