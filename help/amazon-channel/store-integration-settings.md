# [!UICONTROL Store Integration Settings]

After integrating your store, review and configure the store integration settings through the [!UICONTROL Amazon Store] dashboard. These settings display for *Inactive* and *Active* stores. Here you can change the name of your Amazon store and the email address you associated with the store during store integration.

## Modify store integration settings

1. To show the store [dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md), click **[!UICONTROL View Store]** in a store card.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Store Integration Settings]** in the left-side menu.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Email Address]**, update your preferred contact email address.

1. For **[!UICONTROL New Store Name]**, update the descriptive name for your new Amazon sales channel store. 

   This name appears on the [_[!UICONTROL Amazon Stores]_](./managing-stores.md) tab.

   It is used as a [!DNL Commerce] reference only and identifies the store in the list on the Amazon sales channel home page. It should be something your team can easily identify. For example, your Amazon store that sells in the United States region might be named `Amazon Store USA`.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The _[!UICONTROL Amazon Marketplace Country]_ setting defined during [store integration](./store-integration.md) cannot be updated. To edit the country setting, you must delete the store (under _[!UICONTROL Action]_ on the store card) and add a store for the different country.
