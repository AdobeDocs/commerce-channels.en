# Store integration settings

After integrating your store, review and configure the store integration settings through the [!UICONTROL Amazon Store] dashboard. These settings display for *Inactive* and *Active* stores. Here you can change the name of your Amazon store and the email address you associated with the store during store integration.

## Modify store integration settings

1. To show the store [dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md), click **[!UICONTROL View Store]** in a store card.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Store Integration Settings]** in the left-side menu.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Email Address]**, update your preferred contact email address.

1. For **[!UICONTROL New Store Name]**, update the descriptive name for your new [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] store. 

   This name appears on the [_[!UICONTROL Amazon Stores]_](./managing-stores.md) tab.

   It is used as a [!DNL Commerce] reference only and identifies the store in the list on the [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] home page. It should be something your team can easily identify. For example, your Amazon store that sells in the United States region might be named `Amazon Store USA`.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The _[!UICONTROL Amazon Marketplace Country]_ setting defined during [store integration](./store-integration.md) cannot be updated. To edit the country setting, you must delete the store (under _[!UICONTROL Action]_ on the store card) and add a store for the different country.
