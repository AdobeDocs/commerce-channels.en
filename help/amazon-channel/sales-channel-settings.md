# Sales Channel settings

When the [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] extension is installed, default values are set in the Admin for Amazon sales channel. These settings can be modified in your configuration settings for your Amazon store. These settings include:

- Intervals for clearing Activity Log history
- Cron source selection
- Log synchronization options

## Modify the Commerce channels settings

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > _[!UICONTROL Settings]_ > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]**.

1. In the left panel, expand **[!UICONTROL Sales Channels]** and choose **[!UICONTROL Global Settings]**.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Clear Log History]**, choose an option:

   - `Once Daily` - Choose to clear your store activity history once daily.

   - `Once Weekly` - Choose to clear your store activity history once weekly.

   - `Once Monthly` - (Default) Choose to clear your store activity history once monthly.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Background Tasks (CRON) Source]**, choose `Magento CRON`.

   This option allows Amazon sales channel to use your [!DNL Commerce] [Cron](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/system/cron.html) settings to determine communication and data sync intervals with [!DNL Amazon Seller Central].

1. For **[!UICONTROL Enable Debug Logging]**, choose `Enabled` to collect additional synchronization data when troubleshooting is needed.

   Amazon sales channel logging is written to the `{Commerce Root}/var/log/channel_amazon.log` file and can be viewed in [developer mode](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/magento/installation-modes.html){target="_blank"}. Logging should only be `Enabled` during troubleshooting and should be `Disabled` when troubleshooting is complete.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Config]**.
