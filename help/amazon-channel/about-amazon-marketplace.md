# About [!DNL Amazon Marketplace]

[[!DNL Amazon Marketplace]](https://sell.amazon.com/){target="_blank"} is an e-commerce platform owned and operated by Amazon that enables third-party sellers to sell new or used products. Using [!DNL Amazon Marketplace], third-party sellers gain access to Amazon's world-wide customer base. Merchants who list products on Amazon for sale, including Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source users, are defined by Amazon as "third-party sellers."

Third-party sellers of any size can create an [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account and use the [!DNL Amazon Marketplace] to reach Amazon's global customer base. After an account is created and active, sellers can add and list products for sale, manage orders and inventory, and fulfill orders.

## Amazon listings

Amazon listings contain two categories of information: **product information** and **listing information**.

### Product information

Product information provides data common to every instance of the same product listed on Amazon. For example, several sellers may list a particular brand of yoga pants on Amazon. The general details about the product, such as the name and model number, are the same each time the product is listed. When more than one seller contributes data to a product, Amazon determines which seller's product information appears on the product detail page.

### Listing information

Listing information provides seller-specific information about products. These details often differ from other sellers' listing for the same product. For example, you may sell the same yoga pants as another seller, but your item number, condition, price, or shipping method/time may be different. These details are unique to your listing for the product.

If you want to contribute product information or correct erroneous information on a product detail page, refer to [Amazon: Product Detail](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200335450){target="_blank"}.

## Amazon fulfillment

Amazon offers two options for order fulfillment and shipping:

- **Fulfilled by the merchant (FBM)**: Third-party sellers store their own inventory. When a customer places an order, the seller handles the packaging and shipping to the customer. This option allows you to complete shipments through Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source, or another third party.

- **Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA)**: Third-party sellers store inventory in Amazon's fulfillment centers around the world. When a customer places an order, Amazon handles the packaging and shipping to the customer. Order details and status are sent to Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source.

The [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] extension supports both options, receiving and tracking these orders. As you complete fulfillment, order statuses update automatically. See [Fulfillment Workflows](./fulfillment-workflows.md).

## Before selling on Amazon

Amazon follows a set of policies and workflows to ensure that all sellers and products adhere to specified guidelines. To ensure that your products and account are approved and eligible for listing, you should review the following Amazon information and policies:
