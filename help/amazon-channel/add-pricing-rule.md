# Add pricing rules

Pricing rules can be configured or modified at any time after your store is integrated. Pricing rules are part of [Listing Settings](./listing-settings.md) and can be accessed in the [store dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md).

## Standard price rule

A standard price rule action allows you to increase or decrease an Amazon listing price by a specific percentage or fixed dollar amount relative to the **[!UICONTROL Magento Price Source*]* defined in your [Listing Price](./listing-price.md).

### Add a standard pricing rule
