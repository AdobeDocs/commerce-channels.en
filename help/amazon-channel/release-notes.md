This version of [!DNL Amazon sales channel] includes the following improvements and fixes.

![Fix](../assets/fix.svg) <!--CHAN-xxxx-->The _Order Details_ feature has been redesigned and no longer relies on the _Import Orders_ setting. Order details now appear in the Amazon Sales Channel interface for all orders.

## v4.2.0

[!DNL Amazon sales channel] 4.2.0 is compatible with Adobe Commerce versions 2.3.x but only supported for versions 2.4.x of Magento Open Source, Adobe Commerce, and Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure. If you have a previous [!DNL Amazon sales channel] version installed and attempt to update your Adobe Commerce to version 2.4.0, you are prompted to update the extension before you can complete the Adobe Commerce update.

This version of [!DNL Amazon sales channel] includes a new feature along with improvements and fixes.

![Known issue](../assets/bug.svg) When [!DNL Amazon sales channel] 4.2.0 is integrated with version 2.4.0 and [Inventory Management](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/catalog/inventory.html) is enabled, there is a known issue that prevents the addition of products in your Commerce catalog. This issue will be addressed in a future Commerce release.

![New](../assets/new.svg) [!DNL Amazon sales channel] has been enhanced to accept text-based address data and match it to standardized address formats, including city, state, and zip code. This update enables order and shipping data to synchronize (sync) with Amazon without address errors.<br/>For example, a shopper inputs the city, state, zip code as `Escondido, californiA 92025-1501`. Amazon Sales Channel imports and matches the data to the standard format as `Escondido, CA 92025`, and then syncs it back to Amazon in this standardized format.

![New](../assets/new.svg) Added support for PHP 7.4.

![New](../assets/new.svg) <!--CHAN-4334-->Added support for Adobe Commerce 2.4.x. Previous versions may be compatible with Commerce 2.4.x, but are not supported. See [Upcoming releases](https://devdocs.magento.com/release/){:target="_blank"} for version compatibility. Amazon Sales Channel must be updated to 4.2.0 before the Adobe Commerce 2.4.0 update can be completed.

![Fix](../assets/fix.svg) <!--CHAN-4431-->Corrected an issue that caused an _Access Denied_ error for UK customers.

![Fix](../assets/fix.svg) <!--CHAN-4394-->Corrected an issue that prevented the Amazon shipping status from syncing to the corresponding Commerce order, thus “locking” the order’s shipping status as `Pending` in Commerce and `Unshipped` in Amazon. With the new standardized address feature, these shipping status errors have been resolved.

![Fix](../assets/fix.svg) <!--ticket#-->Updated order synchronization (sync) to ignore failed order imports, thus reducing multiple sync attempts and allowing subsequent imports to process, with order sync requests submitted every five minutes. Sync errors are still recorded in the error log, but marked as "processed" to allow further logging functions. Also, [!DNL Amazon sales channel] now automatically removes excess data collected for orders that fail to create in Commerce.

![Fix](../assets/fix.svg) Updated error logging to collect more information for uncaught exception and extension update errors.

![Fix](../assets/fix.svg) <!--ticket#-->Corrected an issue that caused the initial sync of the _lowest price_ data to fail due to a missing _price_ value.

![Fix](../assets/fix.svg) <!--CHAN-4410-->Corrected issues that caused filtering errors in the _Amazon orders_ view when the date range field is left blank.

![Fix](../assets/fix.svg) <!--CHAN-4439-->Corrected an issue that caused quantity-related stock and fulfillment sync errors. The extension now rounds down quantity values entered as a decimal before syncing with Amazon.<br/> For example, when a merchant manually inputs a quantity of `2.5`, the extension rounds down the value to `2` and then syncs the updated quantity with Amazon.

## v4.1.0

Amazon Sales Channel 4.1.0 is compatible with Adobe Commerce 2.3.x of Commerce Open Source, Adobe Commerce, and Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure. This version of Amazon Sales Channel includes user-interface enhancements, along with minor bug fixes.

![New](../assets/new.svg) <!--4247, 4230-->Changed the order import process to align with Commerce order requirements. These changes correct issues that prevented Commerce from creating the corresponding order for an imported order. See [Manage Orders](managing-orders.md) for information on order blockers and solutions.

![New](../assets/new.svg) <!--CHAN-CHAN-4167, 4297, 4311, 4312, 4324-->Updated the _Recent Orders_ section of the store dashboard and added a new _All Orders_ view that shows all your Amazon orders, including filter options and pagination for viewing more orders. See [Amazon Store Dashboard](amazon-store-dashboard.md) and [View Amazon Orders](amazon-orders-all.md).

![New](../assets/new.svg) Added the _[!UICONTROL Order Notes]_ column of the redesigned _[!UICONTROL Amazon Orders]_ table in both _[!UICONTROL Recent Orders]_ and _[!UICONTROL All Orders]_ views. _[!UICONTROL Order Notes]_ let the merchant know there is an issue with the order's import. See [View Amazon Orders](amazon-orders-all.md).

![New](../assets/new.svg) <!--CHAN-4013-->Updated product condition parameters to align with the [Amazon Renewed](https://sell.amazon.com/programs/renewed) program. See [Renewed Products](renewed-products.md).

![New](../assets/new.svg) <!--CHAN-3680-->Updated [Amazon Order Details](amazon-order-details.md) to include "generic data" for orders that are fulfilled by Amazon. See [Fulfilled by](fulfilled-by.md).

![Fix](../assets/fix.svg) <!--CHAN-4069-->Corrected an issue causing the distortion of icons on the store card.

![Fix](../assets/fix.svg) <!--CHAN-4165-->Corrected an error preventing the _Login_ screen from appearing after the session times out.

![Fix](../assets/fix.svg) <!--CHAN-4211-->Corrected an issue preventing the Amazon order tax amount from importing into the new Commerce order.

![Fix](../assets/fix.svg) <!--CHAN-4234-->Corrected an issue that caused revenue totals displayed on the store dashboard to include orders in `Canceled` or `Error` status.

![Fix](../assets/fix.svg) <!--CHAN-4326-->Corrected an issue that caused order import errors associated with third-party extensions that use _Magento Shipping_ methods to create orders.

![Fix](../assets/fix.svg) <!--CHAN-4357-->Corrected an issue that caused errors when running cron synchronization. A lock has been added on the CLI command that prevents two cron jobs from synchronizing at the same time.

![Fix](../assets/fix.svg) Updated content security policy for support with Commerce version 2.3.5.

## v4.0.0

Amazon Sales Channel 4.0.0 is compatible with versions 2.3.0, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, and 2.3.4 of Magento Open Source, Adobe Commerce, and Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure. This version of Amazon Sales Channel includes many user-interface upgrades, along with minor bug fixes.

![Fix](../assets/fix.svg) **Duplicate Amazon Listings**: <!--CHAN-3593-->A previously reported issue that cause duplicate Amazon listings is now corrected. Prior to this release, the extension added the Country Code for the Amazon region to SKU values when importing listings. The listing matched with the catalog item, but the extension created a new, duplicate listing with the appended SKU.

You can use the [!UICONTROL End Listing(s)] on Amazon option to remove duplicate listings.

![Known issue](../assets/bug.svg) **Duplicate Amazon Listings**: <!--CHAN-3593-->This issue causes the catalog to create an item for an imported listing, using the same SKU but with a region code added on the end. Amazon then processes the modified SKU as a new item and creates a listing. This issue will be addressed in a future release.
