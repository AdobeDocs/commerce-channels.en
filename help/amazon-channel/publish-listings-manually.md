# Manually publish Amazon listings

You can manually publish one or more Amazon listings that have been ended.

1. View one or more listings on the _[!UICONTROL Ended]_ tab on the [Product Listings](./managing-product-listings.md) page (_[!UICONTROL Inactive]_, _[!UICONTROL Active]_, or _[!UICONTROL Ineligible]_ tab).

1. In the left column, click to check each of the listings you want to republish.

1. Under _[!UICONTROL Actions]_, click **[!UICONTROL Publish Product to Amazon]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL OK]** in the confirmation message.

   A message is displayed to confirm that the selected listings are being processed to publish to Amazon.

   Listing information is published to Amazon based on your cron settings. Listing information is sent to Amazon at the next data sync. Until Amazon replies with the listing confirmation, the manually published listings remain on the _Ready to List_ tab with a `List in Progress` status. When the listing confirmation is received from Amazon, the listings move to the _Active_ tab with an `Active` status.
