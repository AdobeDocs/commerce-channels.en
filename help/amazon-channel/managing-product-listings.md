# Manage Amazon listings

Product Listing settings can be modified at any time after your [!DNL Commerce] store is integrated. You can access your listing settings on the [store dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md).

To access your product listings by their listing status, click **[!UICONTROL Manage Listings]** in the _[!UICONTROL Store Listings]_ section. The [_Product Listings_](./managing-listings-by-tab.md) page opens to the _[!UICONTROL Active]_ tab by default.

You can also click **[!UICONTROL Active Listings]**, **[!UICONTROL Inactive Listings]**, and **[!UICONTROL In Progress Listings]** in the _[!UICONTROL Store Listings]_ section to directly access those tabs.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**[!UICONTROL In Progress Listings]** are either your _Ready to List_ listings or your _Incomplete Listings_, depending on your [_Product Listing Actions_](./product-listing-actions.md) settings. See the tab descriptions in [Manage Listings by Status / Tab](./managing-listings-by-tab.md).

See [Manage Listings by Status / Tab](./managing-listings-by-tab.md) and [Manage Listings by Action](./managing-listings-by-action.md).
