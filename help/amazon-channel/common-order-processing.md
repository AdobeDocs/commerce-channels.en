# Common order processing tasks

[[!DNL Commerce] order processing](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/sales/order-processing.html){target="_blank"} can manage your Amazon orders, including emailing the buyer, fulfilling the order (shipping), issuing credits/refunds, adding comments, and more. To manage your Amazon orders, your [**Import Amazon Orders**](./order-settings.md) setting must be set to `Enabled` so that corresponding [!DNL Commerce] orders are created when Amazon orders are received. Amazon order information shows in the *[!UICONTROL Recent Orders]* section of the store dashboard.

When enabled, corresponding [!DNL Commerce] orders are created for Amazon orders, and the Amazon order number shows in the _[!UICONTROL Order Number]_ column. If a corresponding [!DNL Commerce] order is created, click the order number to open the order in the [!DNL Commerce] [order processing](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/sales/order-processing.html){target="_blank"} page. You can manage the order as you do your other [[!DNL Commerce] order processing](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/sales/order-processing.html){target="_blank"}.

The [!DNL Commerce] order number does not show with the _[!UICONTROL Recent Orders]_ information. The [!DNL Commerce] order number only shows when you click the order number on the store dashboard and open the order in [[!DNL Commerce] order processing](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/sales/order-processing.html){target="_blank"}. When viewing the [!DNL Commerce] order, the Amazon Order number appears in the *[!UICONTROL Payment & Shipping Method]* section. It also includes options to *[!UICONTROL View or Cancel Amazon Order]* and *[!UICONTROL View all Amazon Orders]*, depending on the order shipping status.

See [cancel an unshipped order](./cancel-unshipped-order.md).

When processing an Amazon order, Amazon sales channel updates and syncs the order information with your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account. Your cron settings determine how often order information is synced between Amazon and Amazon sales channel.
