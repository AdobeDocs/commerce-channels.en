# Price rule actions

Price Rule Actions define the adjustment calculations that are applied to the price source to determine the listing price.

## Standard price rule

A [standard price rule](./standard-price-rules.md) allows you to increase or decrease an Amazon listing price by a specific percentage or fixed dollar amount relative to the [!DNL Commerce] catalog price (or price source).

|Section|Description|

## Intelligent repricing rule

An [intelligent repricing rule](./intelligent-repricing-rules.md) uses Amazon competitors' pricing to determine your listing price. Competitors are other sellers that are listing the same products you are listing on Amazon.
