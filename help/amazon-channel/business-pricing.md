# (B2B) Business Price

(B2B) Business Price settings are part of your store listing settings. Listing settings are accessed from the [store dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md).

[!DNL Amazon Business] is a marketplace that is exclusive to Amazon registered business accounts and is only available in the United States, France, Germany, and United Kingdom. If the marketplace allows B2B business pricing, it is editable within your listing settings.

[!DNL B2B Business Pricing] allows merchants with business accounts to purchase from each other with the expected performance of the Amazon shopping experience. With B2B business pricing, businesses can offer tiered pricing based on the quantity purchased.

For your products to be listed on the [!DNL Amazon Business (B2B)] site, you must first enable business in your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account. For more information on the B2B feature, see [Amazon: B2B Central](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G202161480/){target="_blank"} (requires Seller Central login).

## Configure (B2B) Business Price settings

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Listing Settings]** on the store dashboard.

   - `Disabled` - (Default) Choose when you do not want to enable business-to-business sales. All other fields in this section are disabled when chosen.

   - `Enabled` - Choose when you want to enable your business-to-business sales. When enabled, the business price is set equal to the list price after all pricing rules have been applied. The business price follows the website pricing scope, if enabled. A business price cannot be less than $1.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Enable Tiered Pricing]**, choose an option.

   - `Disabled` - (Default) Choose when you want the same listing price for all order quantities. When chosen, all _[!UICONTROL Pricing Level]_ fields in this section are disabled.

   You can define up to five quantity/discount settings that set the tier pricing for your business listings. In each row, enter the quantity threshold value and the discount percent to apply. For example, if you enter `5` in the first field of the first row and `5` in the second field, the price applies a 5% discount when another business purchases a quantity of 5 or more.
