# Ineligible Listings

The _[!UICONTROL Ineligible]_ tab shows a list of all the products that are currently published on Amazon but are not eligible as a listing based on your current listing rules. If a previous product was eligible and the listing rules are modified to make it now ineligible, the quantity associated with a product drops to 0 and the product is marked as _ineligible_. However, it is still present on your [!DNL Amazon Seller Account].

To move a product out of the _[!UICONTROL Ineligible]_ tab, you can [modify your listing rules](./listing-rules.md) to allow your products to be eligible.

The available actions on the _[!UICONTROL Ineligible]_ tab include:
