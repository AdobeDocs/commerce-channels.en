# View Amazon attribute mapping

As you map Amazon attributes to [!DNL Commerce] attributes, Amazon sales channel tracks and provides a filterable list of all Amazon values. Use this page to verify values for your linked [!DNL Commerce] attributes correctly sync between [!DNL Commerce] and Amazon. You can review synced values for Amazon attribute linked or not linked to a [!DNL Commerce] attribute. To create or edit your Amazon attributes, see [Creating and Editing Attributes](./creating-attributes.md).

The _Amazon Value_ differs depending on the attribute type and the Amazon attribute you view. For example, a listed Amazon value for `Label` would be a text value while `AmazonListPrice` would be a numerical amount. The status indicates if the Amazon value has been imported.

## View your attribute values

1. On the _[!UICONTROL Admin]_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** > _[!UICONTROL Channels]_ > **[!UICONTROL Amazon Sales Channel]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Attributes]** in the left-side menu, locate an Amazon attribute, and click either **[!UICONTROL Create]** or **[!UICONTROL Edit]** in the _[!UICONTROL Action]_ column.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Matching Attribute Values]** tab.

    Listings that have a corresponding [!DNL Commerce] catalog product show a linked value in the _Magento Product SKU_ column. Clicking a link opens the corresponding catalog product detail page. Changes to Amazon attributes on the product detail page do not sync back to Amazon sales channel.

>[!TIP]
>To edit or assign the mapping for a listing to a catalog product, see [Update Required Info](./amazon-manually-update-incomplete-listing.md).
