# Listing Changes Log

The Listing Changes Log shows the changes that have occurred in your [!DNL Amazon Seller Account] as a reflection of your [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] settings. This log indicates the global changes that have been synced between Amazon and [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel]. This log includes listing changes for a product SKU such as the type of action (change), brief description of the change, and the date of the change.

No actions are available for the log. It is a review-only feature.
