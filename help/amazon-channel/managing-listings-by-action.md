# Manage Amazon product listings by action

The _[!UICONTROL Product Listings]_ page contains several tabs from which you can view the statuses of all of your listings and match your products to Amazon listings.

The listing tasks available differ slightly on each tab, but the [workspace controls](./workspace-controls.md) are the same and allow you to customize the data that shows for your listings.

Options under **[!UICONTROL Actions]** can apply the action to multiple listings, while options under **[!UICONTROL Select]** in the _[!UICONTROL Action]_ column apply the action only to the individual listing.

See also [Manage Listings by Status / Tab](./managing-listings-by-tab.md).
