# Renewed products

Before you can list your high-quality, like-new products (refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box) on Amazon, you must first register and be approved for the [[!DNL Amazon Renewed Program]](https://sell.amazon.com/programs/renewed.html){:target="_blank"}.

After you are approved and your [!DNL Seller Central] account is updated, you can manage your renewed listings in Amazon sales channel. Renewed listings require the following steps in [!DNL Commerce]:

- Define your _Refurbished_ settings in your [!UICONTROL Listing Settings] > [[!UICONTROL Product Listing Condition]](./product-listing-condition.md).

- Include `Renewed` in the product title (required by Amazon).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Your renewed product listings that do not meet the requirements set by Amazon change to `Inactive` status and move from the *[[!UICONTROL Active Listings]](./active-listings.md)* tab to the *[[!UICONTROL Inactive Listings]](./inactive-listings.md)* tab. Also, the [[!UICONTROL Listings Changes] log](./listing-changes-log.md) displays a `Refurbished` error message.
