# Onboard Amazon sales channel

This section describes the pre-setup tasks, steps for onboarding, and some key concepts of how Amazon works with the Amazon sales channel in Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source.

The [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] extension supports multiple Amazon stores. For a single [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account that operates in the Amazon U.S./Canada/Mexico region, create three Amazon stores (one each for U.S. sales, Mexico sales, and Canada sales). Each of the three stores defines the marketplace country during its creation. If you have more than one [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account, you could potentially have up to three Amazon stores for each of your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] accounts. If you also sell in the U.K., you would have a fourth Amazon store.

>[!TIP]
>
>A [Professional Seller account](https://sell.amazon.com/){target="_blank"} on [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] in the North America or European (UK) region is required. Amazon charges a monthly subscription and fees for selling. See [Amazon: Choose your selling plan](https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html){target="_blank"}.<br><br>
>Onboarding is simple---create your store and then connect it to your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account.
>When your store is connected, the Amazon channel attempts to import your Amazon listings and match them to your catalog, based on your [attribute mapping](./attributes-view.md).<br><br>
>Your Amazon sales channel settings affect your Amazon listings. Your initial listing, pricing, and product settings are defaulted for you. You can modify your [store settings](./ob-store-review.md) (listing, pricing, order, and reporting) after your store is connected to your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account.

|Steps|What Happens|
|--- |--- |
|[Pre-Setup Tasks](./amazon-pre-setup-tasks.md)|Before you onboard, you must ensure you have an active and approved [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account. There are also some [!DNL Commerce] requirements and recommendations to complete before onboarding.|
|[Verify the Amazon API Key](./amazon-verify-api-key.md)|When accessing Amazon sales channel, [!DNL Commerce] automatically checks and validates the Amazon API key you have added in your store configuration. If your API key has not been added or is invalid, you are prompted to [add or update your Amazon API Key](./amazon-verify-api-key.md).|
|[Store Integration](./store-integration.md)|This step includes creating an Amazon sales channel store and then connecting it to your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account. You need the primary log-in credentials for your [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account (the email or phone used to create the seller account) for this step.|
|[Create Listing Rule](./ob-create-listing-rule.md)|After you connect your Amazon sales channel store, you are prompted to create a listing rule. This step is encouraged, but you can also skip it to start the listing import process. You can also access your [store and listing settings](./ob-store-review.md) on the store [dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md).|
