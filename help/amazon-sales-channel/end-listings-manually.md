When ending a single listing or multiple listings, a message confirms that the selected listing is being processed to end. Ended listings can be managed on the [Ended](./ended-listings.md) tab on the [_Product Listings_](./managing-product-listings.md) page. When processed and removed from Amazon, the status for the listing changes to `Manually Ended`. Ended listings are removed from Amazon until you manually republish the listing using the [_Publish to Amazon_](./publish-listings-manually.md) action.
