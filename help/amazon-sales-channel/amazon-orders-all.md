# View Amazon orders

There are two ways to view your Amazon orders: _Recent Orders_ and _All Orders_.

Both options show you basic order information, as received from Amazon, including:

- Purchase Date
- Order Number
- Status
- Buyer's Name
- Grand Total
- Order Notes

_All Orders_ view adds filtering options for order searches.

>[!NOTE]
>
>With the exception of the _Order Notes_ column, the _Amazon orders_ table is populated with order information as received from Amazon. The _Order Notes_ column is updated by [!DNL Commerce] as the order processes.

## Recent orders

You can view your most recent orders in the _Recent Orders_ section of the [store dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md).

## View all orders

You can view all of your Amazon orders on the _Amazon orders_ page (also referred to as the _All Orders_ view). The Amazon Orders table is similar to the _Recent Orders_ section of the store dashboard, but allows you to view all of your Amazon orders and to narrow your orders list with the following filter options:

- Purchase Date (range)
- Order Number
- Buyer's Name
- Total (range)
- Status

### Changing applied filters

- You can add to or change your filters in the _Filter by_ section. Click **Apply filters** to update the order list and the filter options that appear above the orders grid.

- You can remove filters, either one at a time by clicking the `x` for the filter or all at once by clicking **Clear all filters**. Removing a filter updates the order list and the filter options that appear above the orders grid.

- If your order list is long, you can use the pagination controls below the grid to view more orders.

>[!TIP]
>
>A few tips about the orders view:
>
>- If you have multiple Amazon store integrations, you may need to refresh your page view when switching between store views. This updates both the orders list and the pagination views for the current store.
>- When sorting by column, the sort only applies to the current list view. We suggest filtering your list and then sorting the page you are viewing.
>- Depending on the width of your view window, you may see overlapping text in the columns. Widen your window view to expand the columns for the text to wrap.
>- When filtering by _Total_, filter by whole numbers. Entering a decimal amount may cause errors in the results.
