# Amazon Store dashboard


In the _Amazon Stores_ view on [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] home page, you can click **View Store** on a store card to open the store dashboard.

The store dashboard is the primary location for you to view the activity for each of your Amazon stores. With your [!DNL Amazon Seller] stores added and integrated, orders and sales track through your store data view. On the dashboard, you can view revenue, track trends, and review sales data for your listings. Listings and sales are further grouped and tracked by listing type, including active, inactive, and in-progress.

You can also access your [store settings](./ob-store-review.md), [manage your listings](./managing-product-listings.md), and view sales data and recent order information.

The header of the store dashboard displays the same basic store information that is shown on the store card:

- _Store Name_
- _Magento Website_
- _Status_
- _Created_
- _Last Updated_

The store dashboard also includes store data and links to settings or more information:
