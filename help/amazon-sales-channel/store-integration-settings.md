# Store integration settings

After integrating your store, review and configure the store integration settings through the Amazon Store Dashboard. These settings display for **Inactive** and **Active** stores. Here you can change the name of your Amazon store and the email address you associated with the store during store integration.

## Modify store integration settings

1. Click **View Store** on a store card to show the store [dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md).

1. Click **Store Integration Settings** in the left-side menu.

1. For **Email Address**, update your preferred contact email address.

1. For **New Store Name**, update the descriptive name for your new [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] store. This name appears on the [_Amazon Stores_](./managing-stores.md) tab.

    This name is used as a [!DNL Commerce] reference only and will identify the store in the list on the [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] home page. You will want to make it something your team can easily identify. For example, your Amazon store that sells in the United States region might be named `Amazon Store USA`.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The _[!UICONTROL Amazon Marketplace Country]_ setting defined during [store integration](./store-integration.md) cannot be updated. To edit the country setting, you must delete the store (under _Action_ on the store card) and add a new store for the different country.
