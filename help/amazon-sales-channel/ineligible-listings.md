# Ineligible listings

The _Ineligible_ tab shows a list of all the products that are currently published on Amazon but are not eligible as a listing based on your current listing rules. If a previous product was eligible and the listing rules are modified to make it now ineligible, the quantity associated with a product drops to 0 and the product is marked as _ineligible_. However, it is still present on your [!DNL Amazon Seller Account].

To move a product out of the _Ineligible_ tab, you can [modify your listing rules](./listing-rules.md) to allow your products to be eligible.

The available actions on the _Ineligible_ tab include:

Under _Actions_:

- **[!UICONTROL End Listing(s) on Amazon]**: Choose to remove all selected listings from the [!DNL Amazon Marketplace]. See [End an Amazon Listing](./end-listings-manually.md).

- **[!UICONTROL Edit Listing Overrides]**: Choose to change the override settings for the listing. See [Overrides](./overrides.md) or [Edit or remove an override](./creating-editing-overrides.md#edit-override-single-listing).

This action is for viewing only. No changes can be made in the listing details. See [View Details](./product-listing-details.md).

- **[!UICONTROL Create Override]**: Choose to create an override and apply it to this listing. See [Create an override](./creating-editing-overrides.md).
