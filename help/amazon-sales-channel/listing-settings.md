# View listing settings

Listing settings are accessed from the [store dashboard](./amazon-store-dashboard.md).

These settings define how your [!DNL Commerce] catalog products are listed on Amazon. Your listing settings consist of several categories that allow you to define the interactions and communication between [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] and your respective [!DNL Amazon Seller Central] account.

When configuring your listing settings, you define your eligibility rules for your [!DNL Commerce] catalog products to automatically published to Amazon as new listings, set up your Amazon listing prices based on your [!DNL Commerce] catalog or on competitor pricing, define your fulfillment method, and more.

You should expand each of the sections and configure as needed.
