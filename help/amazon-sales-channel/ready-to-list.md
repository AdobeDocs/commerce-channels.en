# Ready to List

The _Ready to List_ tab shows your [!DNL Commerce] catalog products that meet your listing settings and are ready to publish to Amazon as a **new** listing. Unlike other listing tabs, this tab does not always appear on the [_Product Listings_](./managing-product-listings.md) page.

The _Ready to List_ tab appears only when [**Automatic List Action**](./product-listing-actions.md) in your listing settings is set to `Do Not Automatically List Eligible Products`. This setting tells [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] that any new Amazon listings must be published manually.

When [**Automatic List Action**](./product-listing-actions.md) is set to `Automatically List Eligible Products`, [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] automatically publishes new listings for your eligible catalog products. Because new listings are published automatically, the _Ready to List_ tab is not displayed.

Under _Actions_:

- **Publish Product to Amazon**: Choose to republish the listing to the [!DNL Amazon Marketplace]. See [Publish an Amazon Listing](./publish-listings-manually.md)

Under **Select** in the _Action_ column:

- **Publish On Amazon**: Choose to republish the listing to the [!DNL Amazon Marketplace]. See [Publish an Amazon Listing](./publish-listings-manually.md).

- **View Details**:Â Choose to view listing details, including the [Listing Activity Log](./product-listing-details.md#listing-activity-log), [Buy Box Competitor Pricing](./product-listing-details.md#buy-box-competitor-pricing), and [Lowest Competitor Pricing](./product-listing-details.md#lowest-competitor-pricing). This action is for viewing only. No changes can be made in the listing details. See [View Details](./product-listing-details.md).

You have a few options to manually [publish a new listing to Amazon](./publish-listings-manually.md).

>[!NOTE]
>If you have listings in process, the number of listings will display in a message above the tabs.

### Common Causes of Ready to List Listings

- **Ready to List** - Product has been matched to an Amazon ASIN and is scheduled to be listed. If [**Automatic List Action**](./product-listing-actions.md) in your listing settings is set to `Do Not Automatically List Eligible Products`, the _Ready to List_ status represents the products which are ready to be manually listed.

- **List in Progress** - The product listing has been submitted to Amazon and is awaiting confirmation of acceptance from Amazon.
