# Edit an assigned ASIN

You can edit the Amazon ASIN value assigned to a product in your [!DNL Commerce] catalog. This feature is helpful if a catalog product was improperly matched to one of your Amazon listings. Changing the assigned ASIN for the listing does not change the ASIN assigned to a product by Amazon. It only changes the Amazon listing to which your catalog product is matched.

When an assigned ASIN is changed:

- [!DNL Commerce] ends your Amazon listings attached to the old ASIN
- Validates the ASIN with Amazon
- Creates a listing for the updated ASIN
- Updates listing information in [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel]

## Edit an assigned ASIN

1. View the listing on the _[!UICONTROL Product Listings]_ page (_[!UICONTROL Inactive]_, _[!UICONTROL Active]_, or _[!UICONTROL Ineligible]_ tab).

1. Under _[!UICONTROL Actions]_, click **[!UICONTROL Edit Assigned ASIN]**.

   This action opens the _[!UICONTROL Product Listing Update]_ page.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Assign ASIN]**, enter the new ASIN value.

1. To save your changes, click **[!UICONTROL Save Listing Update]**.
