# Communication Errors Log

The Communication Errors Log shows any reported communication errors with Amazon. Information includes the affected [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] store, error code and brief description, and the date and time of the error.

No actions are available for the log. It is a review-only feature.

[!DNL Amazon Sales Channel] Home pages share some common [workspace controls](./workspace-controls.md) that allow you to customize the data that is displayed.
