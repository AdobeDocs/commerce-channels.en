# Incomplete listings

The _Incomplete_ tab shows  your [!DNL Commerce] catalog products that meet your Amazon eligibility requirements as defined in your [listing rules](./listing-rules.md) but are missing information required by Amazon before listing (example: the Amazon ASIN or a defined product condition).

There are four possible causes for an incomplete listing, each identified by its status.

The available actions on the _Incomplete_ tab include:

Under _Actions_:

- **Re-attempt to auto match to Amazon listings**: Choose to initiate the automatic process for matching your Amazon listings data to your [!DNL Commerce] catalog.
