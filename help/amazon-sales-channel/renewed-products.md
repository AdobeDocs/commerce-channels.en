# Renewed products

Before you can list your high-quality, like-new products (refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box) on Amazon, you must first register and be approved for the [[!DNL Amazon Renewed Program]](https://sell.amazon.com/programs/renewed.html).

After you are approved and your Seller Central account is updated, you can manage your renewed listings in [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel]. Renewed listings require the following steps in [!DNL Amazon Sales Channel]:

- Define your _Refurbished_ settings in your Listing Settings > [Product Listing Condition](./product-listing-condition.md).

- Include `Renewed` in the product title (required by Amazon).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Your renewed product listings that do not meet the requirements set by Amazon will change to `Inactive` status and move from the [Active Listings](./active-listings.md) tab to the [Inactive Listings](./inactive-listings.md) tab. Also, the [Listings Changes Log](./listing-changes-log.md) will show a `Refurbished` error message.
