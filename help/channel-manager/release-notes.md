## v1.1.0

![New](../assets/new.svg)<!--CHAN-5204--> **Returns and Refunds**â€”Enable Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source storefronts to process returns and refunds for Walmart Marketplace order items purchased through a Channel Manager sales channel. Information and updates about returns and refunds is synchronized between Walmart and Adobe Commerce so that the current data is available in both the storefront and Walmart Marketplace.

![Fixed](../assets/fix.svg)<!--CHAN-5661--> Fixed the `Class Magento\SalesDataExporter\MOdel\OrdersFeed does not exist` error that occurred when resynchronizing Channel Manager orders data using the `bin/magento saas:resync --feed orders` command. The error was resolved by updating the Channel Manager package dependencies for the Sales Data Exporter module, which was renamed from `magento/module-sales-data-exporter` to `magento/module-sales-orders-data-exporter`.
