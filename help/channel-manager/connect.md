# Configure the Commerce Services Connector

The Commerce Services Connector integrates the Channel Manager service with Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source instances. The connector enables data synchronization and communication between the Commerce instance, Channel Manager, and other supporting services.

 The Commerce Services Connector setup is a one-time process required to enable the integration between your Commerce instance and other [Commerce services](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/user-guides/home.html){_tra} like [!DNL Channel Manager], [!DNL Live Search], and [!DNL Product Recommendations]. If you have already configured the connector for another service, you can skip this step.

- Adobe Commerce[Production API keys](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/system/saas.html#apikey){target="_blank"} to enable API access to services required by Channel Manager
