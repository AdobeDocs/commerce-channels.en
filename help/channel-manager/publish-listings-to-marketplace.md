# Publish listings to Walmart

Like other marketplaces, [!DNL Walmart] allows third-party sellers to list items that are sold by others. 

The platform uses product identifiers like UPC and GTIN to match existing [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] listings.
For matched products, the Walmart Marketplace listing updates to include the Commerce product offer when you publish
a product from [!DNL Channel Manager].

Usually, product offers with the lowest prices appear first in the [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] listing, but other factors like reviews also affect placement.

## Match products

When you match products, Channel Manager sends the product data to [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] to search for existing listings with attribute values that match the mapped Commerce product attribute. Match criteria is determined by the [attribute-mapping configuration](map-catalog-attributes.md) for your store channel.

If a match is found, the existing product listing is updated to add your offer.

### Prerequisites

Before matching products, verify that your product catalog attribute values meet Walmart requirements and configure attribute settings. See [Map catalog attributes](map-catalog-attributes.md).

#### Select and match products

1. Open a connected sales channel.

1. From **[!UICONTROL Listings]**, select products for matching that are in *[!UICONTROL Draft]* status.

   ![Select products from Listings and send for matching](assets/products-in-marketplace-sales-channel.png)

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Match Products]**.

   A message indicates the number of products sent for matching.

   ![Send products to the connected sales channel](assets/products-submitted-for-matching.png)
   
   The status for selected products changes to [!UICONTROL *Processing*] until the match operation completes. It can take up to 30 minutes for Walmart Marketplace to complete the match operation.

### Check match status

1.  Select **Refresh products** to view the current product status.

1.  Check the product status.

After the match completes, the status can be *Match* or *Error*.

* **[!UICONTROL Match]** indicates that the product was successfully matched. Your product offer was published to an existing Walmart Marketplace listing. If the [Marketplace store is not active](walmart-prerequisites.md#walmart-marketplace-store-status), *[!UICONTROL Staged for Match]* is displayed in the *[!UICONTROL Status detail]* column.

If your [[!DNL Walmart Marketplace] store is not active](walmart-prerequisites.md#walmart-marketplace-store-status), the *Status Detail* column indicates that the product is *Staged for Match*. Staged products are published automatically when the [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] store is activated.

* **[!UICONTROL Error]** indicates that the match operation failed due to one of the following issues:

  * [!DNL Channel Manager] could not send for matching due to a connection issue.

  * No match was found.

  * Match found, but the listing cannot be published because [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] returned an error code. See *Status Detail** for the error description.
  
### Check listing on Walmart

After matching products, review the updated product listing and verify product details, price, and inventory quantity from the [[!UICONTROL Walmart Marketplace Seller Account Items] dashboard](https://seller.walmart.com/items-and-inventory/manage-items) to review the updated product. 

### Troubleshoot product match errors

If the product match operation fails with an error, the error message is displayed in the *[!UICONTROL Status detail]* column in the [!UICONTROL Channel Manager] product listing.

Common errors returned are incorrectly formatted Product ID values or missing required attributes.

#### Fix Product ID values
