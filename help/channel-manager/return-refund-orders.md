# Return and Refund Orders

When a buyer requests a return for order items purchased through [!DNL Walmart Marketplace], Walmart creates a return request. [!DNL Channel Manager] monitors the marketplace channel for these requests and automatically synchronizes the return request information to Channel Manager.

On the Commerce side, the return request initiates the following workflow:

1. Channel Manager creates a corresponding return request with a received status and adds the return ID number ([!UICONTROL RMA #]) to the [!UICONTROL Returns] dashboard. On the [!DNL Orders] dashboard, the status detail for the order associated with the return updates to include a [!UICONTROL Return requested] link to view and process the return.

1. Merchants process the refund associated with the return by creating a Credit Memo following the [Adobe Commerce refund workflow](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/stores-sales/order-management/credit-memos/credit-memos.html). All refunds are processed using the offline method. 

1. [!DNL Channel Manager] sends a refund update to Walmart marketplace so the return status can be updated to reflect the completed refund from Adobe Commerce.

In the storefront Admin, you can view and process returns from Channel Manager by opening the sales channel store and selecting **[!UICONTROL Returns]**.

## Return Status

[!UICONTROL Return Status] provides information about the current state of [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] return requests managed from Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source.

Return status updates occur when [!DNL Channel Manager] receives an return request from the [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] or when the [!DNL Commerce] credit memo is created to process the refund for the returned items.

Returns can have the following statuses:

* **[!UICONTROL Received]**–This is the initial status of the return request received from the [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] store. The merchant can process the refund for the return by selecting **[!UICONTROL Create credit memo]** in the [!UICONTROL Status details].

* **[!UICONTROL Refunded]**—Indicates that a credit memo has been created to issue a refund for the returned items. Merchants can view refund information by selecting **[!UICONTROL View credit memo]** in the [!UICONTROL Status details].

* **[!UICONTROL Error]**—Return requests that have errors. Errors can occur when the return request from Walmart has missing or incorrect data. Or, if [!DNL Channel Manager] cannot send the refund update notification to Walmart.

## Return scenarios

The following scenarios describe how to issue refunds for different types of return requests from [!DNL Channel Manager].

* **Full return**—If the Walmart Marketplace return request is for all items in the order, update the credit memo quantity to refund all items.

* **Partial return**–If the Walmart Marketplace return request is for only some order items, update the credit memo quantity only for the items to be refunded.

* **Return already refunded through Walmart Marketplace**–In some cases, a refund is processed on [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] before you process the return in Channel Manager. For example, if a Commerce order is not refunded within the 48-hour refund processing window required by Walmart, Walmart automatically refunds the order. When this happens, Channel Manager still synchronizes the return request to Adobe Commerce so you can process the return and issue the credit memo. This workflow ensures that the order detail in [!DNL Commerce] matches the order information in Walmart Marketplace.

> It can take up to five minutes for refund updates to synchronize to [!DNL Walmart Marketplace]. You can check the current return status from the [!DNL Channel Manager] [!UICONTROL Returns] dashboard.
