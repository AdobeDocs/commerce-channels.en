# View and track orders from [!DNL Channel Manager]

[!DNL Walmart Marketplace] order data for [!DNL Commerce] products synchronizes automatically to [!DNL Channel Manager] after [!DNL Walmart] processes the order.

On the [!DNL Commerce] side, a successful synchronization triggers the following actions:

- [!DNL Channel Manager] sends an order acknowledgment to Walmart.

- A corresponding [!DNL Commerce] order is created from the Walmart order.

- The updated order information displays on the [!DNL Channel Manager] Orders dashboard.

In the storefront Admin, you can view order data from [!DNL Channel Manager] by opening the sales channel store and selecting **[!UICONTROL Orders]**.

## Order Status

[!UICONTROL Order Status] provides information about the current state of [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] orders managed from Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source. Order status updates occur when [!DNL Channel Manager] receives updated order information from either the [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] or the [!DNL Commerce] order system. Orders can have the following statuses:           

- **[!UICONTROL Shipped]**—Orders that have been shipped from the [!DNL Commerce] store.</br></br> When the order ships, [!DNL Channel Manager] sends an update to [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] to update the shipping status on Walmart and provide the order tracking number for the shipment. After an order has been shipped, order items can be partially or fully refunded if Walmart issues a Return Merchandise Authorization form. See [Returns and Refunds](return-refund-orders.md).

- **[!UICONTROL Partially Shipped]**—Orders that have some items marked as shipped, and others waiting to be shipped. When items in the order ship, [!DNL Channel Manager] sends an update to [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] to update the shipping status to _[!DNL Partially Shipped]_ on Walmart and provide the order tracking number for the shipment. 

- **[!UICONTROL Canceled]**—Orders that have been canceled from the [!DNL Commerce] store.

  After the order cancellation completes, the [!DNL Commerce] stock quantity updates to reflect returned items. Then, [!DNL Channel Manager] syncs the update to the [!DNL Walmart Marketplace].

- **[!UICONTROL Return requested]**—Shipped orders that have a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) request issued by Walmart Marketplace have a `Return requested` link in the [!UICONTROL Status details] column. Selecting the link opens the [!UICONTROL Returns] dashboard to view the RMA and manage the refund process.

- **[!UICONTROL Error]**—Orders that have errors. Errors can occur when an order update operation fails. For example, errors occur if [!DNL Channel Manager] cannot receive a new order from Walmart. They can also occur if [!DNL Channel Manager] cannot send an order shipment or cancellation update to the [!DNL Walmart Marketplace]. If an operation fails, the Orders page shows an _Error_ status for the order. For details, see [Fix order errors](process-orders.md#fix-shipping-and-cancellation- errors).

- **[!UICONTROL Error description]**–Provides detailed information about order errors that occur due to issues like 
missing information or invalid values, incorrect shipment details, or a failed order cancellation. The description helps determine whether error occurred on the [!DNL Commerce] instance or on the [!DNL Walmart Marketplace].

>[!NOTE]
>
>If order items are sent in multiple shipments, the order status in [!DNL Channel Manager] reflects the last order status available. For example, if the first item ships and no errors are returned when order updates are synchronized to [!DNL Channel Manager] and [!DNL Walmart Marketplace], the [!DNL Channel Manager] order status is _[!UICONTROL Partially Shipped]_. If a second item is shipped and [!DNL Channel Manager] returns an error, the order status updates to _[!UICONTROL Error]_.
