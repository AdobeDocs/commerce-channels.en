### About Listing Status              

In the Listing workspace, the Status label shows where a product is in the [!DNL Channel Manager] workflow so you can determine next steps and resolve errors. Listings can have the following status labels:

*  **[!UICONTROL Draft]**–Identifies products that have not been [submitted to [!DNL Walmart] for matching](connect-listings-to-marketplace.md#match-products).

*  **[!UICONTROL Processing]**—Identifies products submitted for matching on the [!DNL Walmart Marketplace]. Products remain in *Processing* status until the [!DNL Walmart] returns an HTTP status message that indicates whether the match was successful, or if there was an error. It can take up to 30 minutes for the match operation to complete on the [!DNL Walmart Marketplace].

* **[!UICONTROL Match]**–Identifies products that were matched successfully on [!DNL Walmart].
    
    A match occurs when the product attribute value—UPC code for example—matches the UPC value in an existing [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] listing. When a product matches, the Commerce product offer is added to the existing listing.

    Check the [[!UICONTROL Walmart Marketplace Seller Account Items]](https://seller.walmart.com/items-and-inventory/manage-items) dashboard to review the updated product listing and verify product details, price, and inventory quantity.  

* **[!UICONTROL Match - Match in Stage]**—Identifies products matched on [!DNL Walmart] that cannot be connected until the [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] store is live. Products with this status connect automatically when the [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] store goes live.

* **[!UICONTROL Error]**—Identifies products that were not matched to an existing [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] listing.

* **[!UICONTROL Error description]**—Provides detailed information about the listing error.

  After you resolve the error, resubmit the product for matching. See [Troubleshoot product match errors](connect-listings-to-marketplace.md#troubleshoot-product-match-errors).
