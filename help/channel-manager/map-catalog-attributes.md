# Map catalog attributes

Before you publish listings from [!DNL Commerce] to [!DNL Walmart Marketplace], you must map at least one unique identifier from your [!DNL Commerce] catalog to the corresponding identifier from Walmart. 
This step is required to match [!DNL Commerce] products to existing [!DNL Walmart] listings and to synchronize product data between [!DNL Commerce] and [!DNL Walmart].

For product matching, the [!DNL Commerce] product must have at least one product attribute that matches one of the following Product Identifiers (Product IDs) required by [!DNL Walmart].

**Required [!DNL Walmart] product IDs**
