# Add products to sales channel store

To sync products to the Walmart Marketplace sales channel, you select products from the [!DNL Commerce] product catalog and import them to Channel Manager. The selected products must have the following attribute configuration:

- **[!UICONTROL Publish to Channel Manager]** attribute is enabled

- At least one product attribute must match one of the [required Walmart Marketplace attributes](map-catalog-attributes.md)â€“GTIN, ISBN, ISSN, UPC, EAN

The process to import products from [!DNL Commerce] to Channel Manager can take up to 30 minutes or more depending on how many products you select.

## Add products

1. From a connected sales channel store, select **Add products** to open the product catalog.
