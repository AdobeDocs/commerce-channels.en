# About [!DNL Channel Manager]

[!DNL Channel Manager] helps merchants increase sales, reach new customers, streamline sales operations, and save time by integrating an Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source product catalog with the [!DNL Walmart Marketplace].

[!DNL Channel Manager] supports Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source merchants who want to sell on [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] by extending the [!DNL Commerce] Admin. With [!DNL Channel Manager] installed, store administrators and operations staff can manage [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] sales, inventory, and product pricing seamlessly from the Commerce environment. 

The extended Admin streamlines operations because merchants can use the same workflows and processes to manage sales from both [!DNL Commerce] storefronts and the Walmart Marketplace.

After you install and configure [!DNL Channel Manager], you can use the following capabilities to manage Walmart Marketplace sales orders:

* **Listing management**–Easily connect product listings by matching products from your [!DNL Commerce] catalog to existing [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] listings.

* **Inventory management**–Items in the merchant's marketplace seller account are automatically synchronized and updated from [!DNL Commerce] to ensure accurate inventory levels.

* **Pricing updates**—Maintain accurate pricing for marketplace listings with automatic price synchronization. When a price changes in Adobe Commerce, the changes are reflected in the marketplace.

* **Order management**—When new orders are created in the marketplace, [!DNL Channel Manager] synchronizes orders with Adobe Commerce, and sends order acknowledgments to the marketplace. This acknowledgment ensures that inventory is reserved for each order. The final step is to create the corresponding orders in the [!DNL Commerce] Order Management system for processing.

* **Shipping management**—When orders are marked as shipped in Adobe Commerce, the shipment update is sent to the [!DNL Walmart Marketplace]. This notification ensures that sellers meet their fulfillment SLA requirements and that customers receive shipping update notifications for their current orders.

* **Cancellations**—When orders are canceled in Adobe Commerce, [!DNL Channel Manager] sends updated order information to the marketplace to replicate the action for the corresponding marketplace order. After the order cancellation completes, the [!DNL Commerce] stock quantity updates to reflect returned items and inventory updates are synchronized automatically to [!DNL Walmart Marketplace].

* **Returns and Refunds**—When Walmart Marketplace issues a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) for items ordered through an Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source sales channel store, [!DNL Channel Manager] sends the RMA information to the Commerce sales channel store to replicate the return request. Then, the refund can be processed using the [!DNL Commerce] [refund workflow](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/sales/credit-memos.html#refund-workflow), offline method. After the refund completes, [!DNL Channel Manager] synchronizes the update to Walmart so that the RMA status in the marketplace seller account can be updated to reflect the refund.
