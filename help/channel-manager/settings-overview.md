* **[Map Shipping Carriers](map-shipping-carriers.md)–Before you process [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] orders from [!DNL Commerce], ensure that you map shipping carriers from your [!DNL Commerce] instance to the corresponding carriers on [!DNL Walmart Marketplace].

If needed, you can update these credentials from the *Settings* page.
