# Settings Overview

Sales channel settings enable communication and data synchronization between [!DNL Commerce] and [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] so you can manage [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] sales operations from the [!DNL Commerce] Admin.

In [!DNL Channel Manager], you configure some sales channels settings during the onboarding process. After onboarding, you can view and manage the configuration by selecting **[!UICONTROL Channel Settings]** from the [!UICONTROL Listings] and [!UICONTROL Orders] dashboards.

* **[Walmart connection](manage-wmt-connection.md)**–During the [!DNL Channel Manager] onboarding process, you provide [API credentials](walmart-requirements.md#generate-a-walmart-marketplace-production-api-key) from your [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] Seller account to connect [!DNL Commerce] to [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] for communication and data synchronization. If needed, you can update these credentials from the *Channel Settings* page.

* **[Map Unique identifiers](map-catalog-attributes.md)**–Before you connect listings from [!DNL Commerce] to [!DNL Walmart Marketplace], map at least one unique identifier from your [!DNL Commerce] catalog to the corresponding identifier from Walmart. This step is required to match [!DNL Commerce] products to existing [!DNL Walmart] listings and to synchronize product data between [!DNL Commerce] and [!DNL Walmart].

* **[Map Shipping Carriers](map-shipping-carriers.md)**–Before you process [!DNL Walmart Marketplace] orders from [!DNL Commerce], ensure that you map shipping carriers from your [!DNL Commerce] instance to the corresponding carriers on [!DNL Walmart Marketplace].
